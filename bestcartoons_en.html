    <p style="font-size: 25px;">27 May 2024</p><hr>
    <p>Nowdays, people that still like to watch cartoons are rare, because the graphic is 2D and the plot is simple. Most people like to watch movie and drama. The most famous examples are American movies and South Korean dramas.</p>
    <p>Most cartoons have a simple plot, need one episode to defeat the antagonist, usually in the climax part of a cartoon. But there are also cartoons that have a complex plot like in drama or anime. That kind of cartoon needs at least several episodes until one or several seasons, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of an episode.</p>
    <p>Even though, there are some cartoons that are good and fun to watch. What are those? Let's see together!</p><br>
    <h2>1. Code Lyoko</h2>
    <img src="codelyoko.jpg" width="640" height="360">
    <p>Who were born in 2004 but doesn't know this cartoon? This cartoon is certainly familiar for those who were born in 2004. From kindergarten until third grade, everytime after school would watch this cartoon in Spacetoon until the channel is deleted, precisely 18 May 2013. How nostalgic to remembering the past while could watch Spacetoon before it is finally deleted and switch to watching Naruto in Global TV and Western movies. This cartoon is also famous because of its wide forehead, leading Indonesians to call it 'jenong'.</p>
    <p>Code Lyoko is a French cartoon that was released on 3 September 2003 and ended on 10 November 2007. Consists total of 97 episodes (95 episodes and 2 specials) with 4 seasons, this cartoon is produced by Antefilms Productions in season 1 and MoonScoop Group from season 2 until season 4. The genres are action, adventure, and science fiction. Despite its special episode (XANA Awakens) was released after season 2 ended (episode 52), it's recommended to watch the special episode first, and then episode 1 until finish (episode 95), because it is based on chronological order.</p>
    <p>This cartoon is about a group of teenagers named Ulrich, Yumi, Odd, and Jeremy that found an AI unit in an abandoned factory. In the special episode XANA Awakens, all members are seventh graders (first year of junior high school), except Yumi is an eighth grader (second year of junior high school). In season 1 and season 2, they got promoted to next grade, so the same in season 3 and season 4. They live in dormitory in Kadic Academy, except Yumi that lives with her family in home. They also have free breakfast, lunch, and dinner, like most schools in United States. Ulrich and Odd are roomates with Odd's dog named Kiwi.</p>
    <p>They participate in learning activities at school as usual, until a creature named XANA causes chaos in real world. When that happens, they would ask a permission to teacher to go to toilet or infirmary, but the truth is they want to go to virtual world to stop XANA. From the school to the factory, they go to the forest through the school entrance, walk deeper until found a manhole to enter the sewer, and using the skateboard to the stairs to access the bridge to the factory. After arrived, they entered the elevator heading downstairs. The other members enter to an unit to access the virtual world, wheras Jeremy would use the computer that can see each member's HP (health point), types of monster that will be faced, and tower location. In the virtual world, there are four different places (we would call biome in the game Minecraft), that are desert, forest, arctic, and mountains. Different place, the monsters are also different, but there are some that are same. There, they meet Aelita, a girl that was trapped in the virtual world, and only she can enter the tower to deactivate it, and return to the past, automatically chaos disappeared, and so on. In one episode, Aelita succeed to go back to real world and go to school with other students.</p>
